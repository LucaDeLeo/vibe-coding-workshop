# Simple Todo App Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable users to efficiently create, manage, and complete tasks
- Provide a clean, intuitive interface for task organization
- Support persistent storage of todo items across sessions
- Allow basic task categorization and prioritization
- Deliver a responsive web application accessible from any device

### Background Context
The Simple Todo App addresses the fundamental need for personal task management in an increasingly busy digital world. While numerous todo applications exist, this project focuses on delivering core functionality with exceptional user experience, avoiding feature bloat that often complicates simple task management. The app targets individuals seeking a straightforward, reliable tool for organizing daily tasks without unnecessary complexity.

- NFR7: Todo data must persist across browser sessions
- NFR8: The app must handle up to 1000 todo items without performance degradation

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
A minimalist, distraction-free interface that puts focus on the tasks themselves. The design follows the principle of "progressive disclosure" - showing essential features prominently while keeping advanced options accessible but not overwhelming.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- Single-click actions for common operations (complete, edit)
- Inline editing for quick modifications
- Visual transitions for state changes
- Contextual actions appear on hover/focus
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users

### Core Screens and Views
- Main Todo List View (primary interface)
- Add Todo Input Area (always visible at top)
- Filter Tabs (All/Active/Completed)
- Todo Item Component (with inline edit capability)
- Empty State View (when no todos exist)

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
The application will meet WCAG AA standards with full keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and proper ARIA labels.

### Branding
Clean, modern aesthetic with a focus on typography and whitespace. Subtle use of color for state indicators (completed items in muted tones, active items in full contrast). Sans-serif font family for clarity and readability.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Web Responsive - optimized for all screen sizes from mobile phones (320px) to desktop displays (1920px+).

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing all frontend code, assets, and configuration.

### Service Architecture
Client-side only application (no backend required). Uses browser local storage for persistence. Built as a Single Page Application (SPA).

### Testing Requirements
Unit tests for core logic (todo CRUD operations, filtering), integration tests for component interactions, and basic e2e tests for critical user flows.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- Framework: React with TypeScript for type safety
- State Management: React Context API (sufficient for app complexity)
- Styling: CSS Modules or Styled Components for scoped styling
- Build Tool: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- Testing: Jest for unit tests, React Testing Library for component tests
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- Deployment: Static hosting on Netlify or Vercel
- No external dependencies for core functionality (self-contained)
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for offline support

## Epic List

- Epic 1: Foundation & Core Todo Functionality: Establish project infrastructure and deliver complete CRUD operations for todo items with local storage persistence
- Epic 2: Enhanced User Experience: Add filtering, bulk operations, drag-and-drop reordering, and responsive design optimizations

## Epic 1: Foundation & Core Todo Functionality

**Goal:** Establish the project foundation with modern React/TypeScript setup and deliver a fully functional todo application with complete CRUD operations and persistent storage. Users will be able to create, view, edit, complete, and delete todos with all changes persisting across browser sessions.

### Story 1.1: Project Setup and Basic UI

I want to set up the project infrastructure with React, TypeScript, and testing framework,
so that we have a solid foundation for building the todo application.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1: Project initialized with Vite, React, and TypeScript
2: Basic component structure created (App, TodoList, TodoItem, AddTodo)
3: CSS modules or styled-components configured for styling
4: Jest and React Testing Library configured with sample test
5: Git repository initialized with appropriate .gitignore
6: Basic responsive layout implemented with header and main content area
7: Development server runs successfully with hot module replacement
8: README created with setup and run instructions

### Story 1.2: Create Todo Functionality

As a user,
I want to add new todo items to my list,
so that I can track tasks I need to complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1: Input field prominently displayed at top of todo list
2: User can type todo title and press Enter or click Add button to create
