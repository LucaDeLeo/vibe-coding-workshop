# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Todo Functionality

**Goal:** Establish the project foundation with modern React/TypeScript setup and deliver a fully functional todo application with complete CRUD operations and persistent storage. Users will be able to create, view, edit, complete, and delete todos with all changes persisting across browser sessions.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Basic UI

As a developer,
I want to set up the project infrastructure with React, TypeScript, and testing framework,
so that we have a solid foundation for building the todo application.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Project initialized with Vite, React, and TypeScript
2: Basic component structure created (App, TodoList, TodoItem, AddTodo)
3: CSS modules or styled-components configured for styling
4: Jest and React Testing Library configured with sample test
5: Git repository initialized with appropriate .gitignore
6: Basic responsive layout implemented with header and main content area
7: Development server runs successfully with hot module replacement
8: README created with setup and run instructions

## Story 1.2: Create Todo Functionality

As a user,
I want to add new todo items to my list,
so that I can track tasks I need to complete.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Input field prominently displayed at top of todo list
2: User can type todo title and press Enter or click Add button to create
3: New todos appear immediately at the top of the list
4: Input field clears after successful addition
5: Empty todo titles are prevented (with visual feedback)
6: Each todo has unique ID and creation timestamp
7: Optional description field available for additional details
8: Focus returns to input after todo creation for quick multiple entries

## Story 1.3: Display and Complete Todos

As a user,
I want to view my todos and mark them as complete,
so that I can track my progress on tasks.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: All todos displayed in a vertical list with clear visual separation
2: Each todo shows title, completion status, and creation time
3: Checkbox or click area to toggle completion status
4: Completed todos show strikethrough text and muted colors
5: Completion state changes are immediate with smooth transition
6: Active todo count displayed prominently
7: Todos maintain their order when completed/uncompleted
8: Visual hover states for interactive elements

## Story 1.4: Edit and Delete Todos

As a user,
I want to edit and delete existing todos,
so that I can keep my list accurate and relevant.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Edit mode triggered by clicking on todo text or edit button
2: Inline editing with pre-filled current values
3: Save on Enter key or blur, cancel on Escape key
4: Delete button/icon visible on hover or always visible on mobile
5: Confirmation required before deletion (modal or inline)
6: Visual feedback during edit mode (highlighted border)
7: Changes reflected immediately in the UI
8: Proper focus management during edit/delete operations

## Story 1.5: Local Storage Persistence

As a user,
I want my todos to persist between browser sessions,
so that I don't lose my task list when I close the browser.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: All todos saved to localStorage on every change
2: Todos loaded from localStorage on app initialization
3: Graceful handling of corrupted localStorage data
4: Storage quota exceeded handled with user notification
5: Data structure versioning for future migration support
6: Timestamp preserved for creation date across sessions
7: Performance optimized for up to 1000 todos
8: Clear storage option available in browser developer tools
