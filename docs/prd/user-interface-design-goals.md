# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
A minimalist, distraction-free interface that puts focus on the tasks themselves. The design follows the principle of "progressive disclosure" - showing essential features prominently while keeping advanced options accessible but not overwhelming.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- Single-click actions for common operations (complete, edit)
- Inline editing for quick modifications
- Visual transitions for state changes
- Contextual actions appear on hover/focus
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users

## Core Screens and Views
- Main Todo List View (primary interface)
- Add Todo Input Area (always visible at top)
- Filter Tabs (All/Active/Completed)
- Todo Item Component (with inline edit capability)
- Empty State View (when no todos exist)

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
The application will meet WCAG AA standards with full keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and proper ARIA labels.

## Branding
Clean, modern aesthetic with a focus on typography and whitespace. Subtle use of color for state indicators (completed items in muted tones, active items in full contrast). Sans-serif font family for clarity and readability.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Web Responsive - optimized for all screen sizes from mobile phones (320px) to desktop displays (1920px+).
