# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing all frontend code, assets, and configuration.

## Service Architecture
Client-side only application (no backend required). Uses browser local storage for persistence. Built as a Single Page Application (SPA).

## Testing Requirements
Unit tests for core logic (todo CRUD operations, filtering), integration tests for component interactions, and basic e2e tests for critical user flows.

## Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- Framework: React with TypeScript for type safety
- State Management: React Context API (sufficient for app complexity)
- Styling: CSS Modules or Styled Components for scoped styling
- Build Tool: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- Testing: Jest for unit tests, React Testing Library for component tests
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- Deployment: Static hosting on Netlify or Vercel
- No external dependencies for core functionality (self-contained)
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for offline support
